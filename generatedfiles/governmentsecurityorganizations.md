{octicon}`check-circle;1em;caption-text` **Cybersecurity Library of US DoD**

Great collection of links to valuable security resources. Use it and improve it for your context! Also using these resources is good for inspiration when you need to create your own security architecture or how to perform a complex risks analyses in a large environment. Zero Trust is everywhere, but I like the DoD created [Zero Trust reference architecture](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/(U)ZT_RA_v2.0(U)_Sep22.pdf)
