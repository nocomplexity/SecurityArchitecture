# Open Security Reference Architecture

IT Security is a complex field. People, processes and technology are crucial parts of an architecture to reduce risks. Our certified experts love to solve your cyber security challenges. Detecting what is not good with your current security is the simple work. You can find many companies that launch automated test suites based on open source tools that tell you that you are not secure enough. However the real challenge is designing solutions that are secure.


Good Open publications for cyber security are hard to find. 

This [Security Reference Architecture](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securityarchitecture/introduction.html) aims to enable you to create better and faster security solutions. You SHOULD use and reuse content that is provided in this reference architecture to prevent reinventing the wheel. 

To encourage collaboration for this project this reference architecture is of course free and open (cc-by-sa).

This project is supported by the [BM-Support Foundation](https://www.bm-support.org/). 


The initial version (2015) of this project was called the 'Open Reference Architecture for Security and Privacy'. However we decided to split this project in a pure security reference architecture Guide and a [privacy playbook](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/simplifyprivacy/intro.html). 


# Contributing

You don’t have to be a security expert to contribute, every contribution is welcome!

We encourage all security professionals to improve this reference architecture. You can help by:
* Add security principles.
* Add security models.
* Add threat models that can be easily reused.
* Add links towards open (cc-by) solutions created by government’s or foundations.
* Provide an URL to enhance the collection of open access resources that helps creating a security architecture faster and better!

Your contributions to this Guide are greatly appreciated as long as contributions fit within the scope and goal of this security reference architecture. As an open project, this Security Architecture shall always remain vendor-neutral and freely available for all to use. If you contribute you will of course get credit (mentioned in upcoming publications).

* This reference architecture is intended to be a helpful resource aimed at professional security architects and engineers.
* Contributions must fit within the scope and goal of this security reference architecture.
