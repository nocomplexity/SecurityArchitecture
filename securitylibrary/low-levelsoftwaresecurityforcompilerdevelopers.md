# Low-Level Software Security for Compiler Developers


<br />

| Book Info | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Author | Anders Waldenborg e.a. |
| Description | With software security becoming even more important in recent years, it is no surprise to see an ever increasing variety of security hardening features and mitigations against vulnerabilities implemented in compilers. This book aims to help developers of code generation tools such as JITs, compilers, linkers and assemblers to overcome this. |
