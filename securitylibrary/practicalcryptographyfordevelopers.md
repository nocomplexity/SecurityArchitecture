| Description | A modern practical book about cryptography for developers with code examples, covering core concepts like: hashes (like SHA-3 and BLAKE2), MAC codes (like HMAC and GMAC), key derivation functions (like Scrypt, Argon2), key agreement protocols (like DHKE, ECDH), symmetric ciphers (like AES and ChaCha20, cipher block modes, authenticated encryption, AEAD, AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305), asymmetric ciphers and public-key cryptosystems (RSA, ECC, ECIES), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC, secp256k1, curve25519), digital signatures (ECDSA and EdDSA), secure random numbers (PRNG, CSRNG) and quantum-safe cryptography, along with crypto libraries and developer tools, with a lots of code examples in Python and other languages. |
| Notice | This is a great read, but mind: Not fully finised and the online version has error. See the issues in the repository.  |
