# NCSC:Secure design principles

The UK National Cyber Security Centre provides solid information to simplify cyber security for small and large organisations. All material is [open](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

## Five principles for the design of cyber secure systems

1. Establish the context before designing a system
    Before you can create a secure system design, you need to have a good understanding of the fundamentals and take action to address any identified short-comings.
    
2. Make compromise difficult
    Designing with security in mind means applying concepts and using techniques which make it harder for attackers to compromise your data or systems.
    
3. Make disruption difficult
    When high-value or critical services rely on technology for delivery, it becomes essential that the technology is always available. In these cases the acceptable percentage of ‘down time’ can be effectively zero.
    
4. Make compromise detection easier
    Even if you take all available precautions, there’s still a chance your system will be compromised by a new or unknown attack. To give yourself the best chance of spotting these attacks, you should be well positioned to detect compromise.
    
5. Reduce the impact of compromise
    Design to naturally minimise the severity of any compromise.
