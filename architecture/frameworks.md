# Frameworks

## Cyber SecurityFramework (Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority)

To improve cyber resilience, the Saudi Arabian government created mandatory guidelines to strengthen their constituents’ security postures and provide prescriptive measures to defend against today’s cyber threats.

SAMA  established a Cyber Security Framework (“the Framework”) to enable Financial  Institutions to effectively identify and address risks related to cyber security.

## In-toto

[In-toto](https://in-toto.io/): A framework to secure the integrity of software supply chains.


```{admonition} What is in-toto?
:class: tip 

in-toto is designed to ensure the integrity of a software product from initiation to end-user installation. It does so by making it transparent to the user what steps were performed, by whom and in what order. As a result, with some guidance from the group creating the software, in-toto allows the user to verify if a step in the supply chain was intended to be performed, and if the step was performed by the right actor.

## NIST Security framework

Whenever you feel the need to draw a process regarding security or risk
processes: resist the temptation! The US based NIST organization is a
well-known governmental organization that offers great publications on
all thinkable subjects regarding security.

One of the simplest, yet most frequently model is displayed here below.

On the NIST site (see references) you can find in-depth information
regarding all sub functions of this security framework. The experience
is, is that it is far better to check what in your use case needs
special attention. If you ever feel the need to create your own security
framework, think again. In essence all come down to the high level
framework described by the NIST organization. Using a broad used
security framework has a number of advantages:

-   Easier communication with stakeholders;
-   Easier knowledge and experience transfer between security experts of
    different organization;
-   Saves time, time you can use to solve the real context specific
    issues regarding practice use and implementation of the security
    functions.


## NIST Risk Management Framework RMF

The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides a comprehensive, flexible, repeatable, and measurable 7-step process that any organization can use to manage information security and privacy risk for organizations and systems and links to a suite of NIST standards and guidelines to support implementation of risk management programs to meet the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA).

## Open Software Supply Chain Attack Reference (OSC&R)

A great framework for Releasing Secure Products.

Make security a part of product development.

## The Update Framework

The Update Framework (TUF) helps developers maintain the security of software update systems, providing protection even against attackers that compromise the repository or signing keys. TUF provides a flexible framework and specification that developers can adopt into any software update system.

TUF is hosted by the Linux Foundation as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and is used in production by various tech companies and open source organizations. 

Check: https://theupdateframework.io/ 

This project is a Linux Foundation project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)


Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or SLSA ("salsa"). It’s a security framework, a checklist of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure. It’s how you get from "safe enough" to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the chain.


```{hint} More information:

## Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)

Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models explicitly address software security in detail, so secure software development practices usually need to be added to each SDLC model to ensure that the software being developed is well-secured. This document recommends the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) – a core set of high-level secure software development practices that can be integrated into each SDLC implementation. 

Check [ NIST SP 800-218 Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final)

## Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)

The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework is an open-source project, delivering an extensible framework for developing schemas, along with a vendor-agnostic core security schema.
The framework is made up of a set of data types, an attribute dictionary, and the taxonomy. It is not restricted to the cybersecurity domain nor to events, however the initial focus of the framework has been a schema for cybersecurity events.

## VERIS Framework

The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) is a set of metrics designed to provide a common language for describing security incidents in a structured and repeatable manner. VERIS is a response to one of the most critical and persistent challenges in the security industry - a lack of quality information. VERIS targets this problem by helping organizations to collect useful incident-related information and to share that information - anonymously and responsibly - with others.
