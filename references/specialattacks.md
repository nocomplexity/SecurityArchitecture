# Famous Attacks

Some cyber vulnerabilities have become famous. Sometime by the impact, some by the research paper and the impact on the security field! 

This is an opinionated collection of vulnerabilities and attacks that are so special, that the have an own website and often also one or more research papers.

:::{warning}
Most so called **old** famous attacks and vulnerabilities are still actively used. Since patching and fixing hardware, firmware and software components is hard, complex and sometimes not possible at all!
