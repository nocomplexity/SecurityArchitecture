Amiunique
---------

Amiunique has shares some goals with panoticlick, but it provides a
number of novelties:

-  amiunique implements the most recent techniques for fingerprinting,
   including webGL and canvas
-  amiunique provides more information to the users, including `global
   statistics <https://amiunique.org/stats>`__, as well as a concise
   summary of the main characteristics of a browser

created and maintained by a team of researchers, who investigates the
software monocultures and software diversity on the web. The research
team is financially supported by the `DIVERSIFY European
project <http://diversify-project.eu>`__ and by a grant from the
`INSA-Rennes school <http://www.insa-rennes.fr/en.html>`__.

Blockstack
----------

Blockstack is a new decentralized internet where users own their data
and apps run locally. A browser portal is all that’s needed to get
started.

With Blockstack, users control their data and apps run on their devices.
There are no middlemen, no passwords, no massive data silos to breach,
and no services tracking us around the internet.

The applications on blockstack are server-less and decentralized.
Developers start by building a single-page application in Javascript,
Then, instead of plugging the frontend into a centralized API, they plug
into an API run by the user. Developers install a library called
‘blockstack.js’ and don’t have to worry about running servers,
maintaining databases, or building out user management systems.

GNUnet
------

GNUnet is a mesh routing layer for end-to-end encrypted networking and a
framework for distributed applications designed to replace the old
insecure Internet protocol stack.

In other words, GNUnet provides a strong foundation of free software for
a global, distributed network that provides security and privacy. Along
with an application for secure publication of files, it has grown to
include all kinds of basic applications for the foundation of a GNU
internet.

GNUnet is an official GNU package.

The foremost goal of the GNUnet project is to become a widely used,
reliable, open, non-discriminating, egalitarian, unfettered and
censorship-resistant system of free information exchange. We value free
speech above state secrets, law-enforcement or intellectual property.
GNUnet is supposed to be an anarchistic network, where the only
limitation for peers is that they must contribute enough back to the
network such that their resource consumption does not have a significant
impact on other users. GNUnet should be more than just another
file-sharing network. The plan is to offer many other services and in
particular to serve as a development platform for the next generation of
decentralized Internet protocols.

IRMA
----

IRMA offers a privacy-friendly, flexible and secure solution to many
authentication problems, putting the user in full control over his/her
data.

IRMA contains an app (also OSS), a server and providers. See the site
https://privacybydesign.foundation/irma-start/ for more information

The IRMA app manages the user’s IRMA attributes: receiving new
attributes, selectively disclosing them to others, and attaching them to
signed statements. These attributes can be relevant properties, such as:
“I am over 18”, “my name is …” and “I am entitled to access ….”. They
are only stored on the user’s device and nowhere else.

MAT: Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit
-----------------------------------

MAT is a toolbox composed of a GUI application, a CLI application and a
library, to anonymize/remove metadata.

Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data
about when and where a picture was taken and what camera was used.
Office documents like pdf or Office automatically add author and company
information to documents and spreadsheets. Maybe you don’t want to
disclose this information on the web.

Mat only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their
content, nor handle watermarking, steganography, or any overly
customized metadata field/system. Also please not that MAT does its best
to scrub as much metadata as possible, it’s not really efficient at
scrubbing embedded media inside complex formats. For examples, images
embedded inside PDF may not be cleaned!

Matrix
------

Matrix is an ambitious new ecosystem for open federated Instant
Messaging and VoIP. The basics you need to know to get up and running
are:

-  Everything in Matrix happens in a room. Rooms are distributed and do
   not exist on any single server. Rooms can be located using
   convenience aliases like ``#matrix:matrix.org`` or
   ``#test:localhost:8448``.
-  Matrix user IDs look like ``@matthew:matrix.org`` (although in the
   future you will normally refer to yourself and others using a third
   party identifier (3PID): email address, phone number, etc rather than
   manipulating Matrix user IDs)

The overall architecture is:

::

    client <----> homeserver <=====================> homeserver <----> client
           https://somewhere.org/_matrix      https://elsewhere.net/_matrix

Open Whisper (Signal)
---------------------

Signal is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends.
Signal uses your phone’s data connection (WiFi/3G/4G) to communicate
securely, optionally supports plain SMS/MMS to function as a unified
messenger, and can also encrypt the stored messages on your phone.

A private messenger for Android and IOS. Used by Clinton team nowadays.

Private messaging For iPhone and Android. Features:

-  Say Anything – Send high-quality group, text, picture, and video
   messages, all without SMS and MMS fees.
-  Be Yourself – Use your existing phone number and address book. There
   are no separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or
   lose.
-  Stay Private – We cannot read your messages, and no one else can
   either. Everything is always end-to-end encrypted and painstakingly
   engineered in order to keep your communication safe.
-  Pay Nothing – The development team is supported by community
   donations and grants. There are no advertisements, and it doesn’t
   cost anything to use.

Note: Some famous hackers have serious doubt on the privacy and
especially NSA involvement with Signal. There alternatives like
`Matrix <https://matrix.org/blog/home/>`__ or
`Tox <https://tox.chat/>`__ that are distributed and can never be
compromised!

Steghide
--------

| Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in
  various kinds of image- and audio-files. The color- respectivly
  sample-frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant
  against first-order statistical tests.
| Features:

-  compression of embedded data
-  encryption of embedded data
-  embedding of a checksum to verify the integrity of the extraced data
-  support for JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU files

Steganography literally means covered writing. Its goal is to hide the
fact that communication is taking place. This is often achieved by using
a (rather large) cover file and embedding the (rather short) secret
message into this file. The result is a innocuous looking file (the
stego file) that contains the secret message.

Streisand
---------

Streisand is software for setting up secure connections with your
friends. A bit like TOR.

Streisand  is open source software that sets up a communication server
that can run:

-  WireGuard
-   OpenConnect
-   OpenSSH
-   OpenVPN
-   Shadowsocks
-  SSHLH
-   Stunnel,  or a
-  Tor bridge.

After configuration Streisand generates custom instructions to use the
communication service chosen. At the end of the run you are given an
HTML file with instructions that can be shared with friends, family
members, and fellow activists.  Setting up Streisand requires still some
good Unix knowledge for installation and configuration. So it is a bit
of a hassle. (status 2018)

Using Streisand reduces the barrier of entry to running a
VPN/censorship-bypass server for friends and family and makes secure
communication available to more people.

Tails
-----

Tails is a (Debian based) operating system, that you can start on almost
any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at preserving
your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to:

-  use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship;
-  all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor
   network;
-  leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it
   explicitly;
-  use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files,
   emails and instant messaging.

Tor
---

Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against
traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal
freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships,
and state security. Creating your own Tor network is easy with this
software, or use existing Tor nodes.

Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family
members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the
like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Using Tor
protects you against a common form of Internet surveillance known as
“traffic analysis.” Traffic analysis can be used to infer who is talking
to whom over a public network. Knowing the source and destination of
your Internet traffic allows others to track your behavior and
interests.

Tor is by far the most secure way to enter the internet without giving
away your privacy. Thank you Roger Dingledine!

Tox
---

Whether it’s corporations or governments, digital surveillance today is
widespread. Tox is easy-to-use software that connects you with friends
and family without anyone else listening in. While other big-name
services require you to pay for features, Tox is completely free and
comes without advertising — forever.

Tox is a peer to peer (serverless) instant messenger aimed at making
security and privacy easy to obtain for regular users. It uses
`NaCl <https://nacl.cr.yp.to/>`__ for its encryption and authentication.

Tribler
-------

Privacy enhanced BitTorrent client with P2P content discovery.

The aim of Tribler is giving anonymous access to online (streaming)
videos. We are trying to make privacy, strong cryptography and
authentication the Internet norm.

Tribler currently offers a Youtube-style service. For instance,
Bittorrent-compatible streaming, fast search, thumbnail previews and
comments. For the past 9 years we have been building a very robust
Peer-to-Peer system. Today Tribler is robust: “the only way to take
Tribler down is to take The Internet down” (but a single software bug
could end everything).

Over 2 million people have used Tribler over the years. The Tribler
project was started in 2005 at Delft University of Technology and over
100+ developers contributed code to it.

WireGuard
---------

WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes
state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner,
and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It
intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is
designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and
super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially
released for the Linux kernel, it plans to be cross-platform and widely
deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it
might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN
solution in the industry.

XPIR: Private Information Retrieval for Everyone

XPIR allows a user to privately download an element from a database.
This means that the database server knows that she has sent a database
element to the user but does not know which one. The scientific term for
the underlying protocol is Private Information Retrieval (PIR). This
library is described and studied in the paper:

Carlos Aguilar-Melchor, Joris Barrier, Laurent Fousse, Marc-Olivier
Killijian, “XPIR: Private Information Retrieval for Everyone”,
Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies. Volume 2016, Issue 2,
Pages 155–174, ISSN (Online) 2299-0984, DOI: 10.1515/popets-2016-0010,
