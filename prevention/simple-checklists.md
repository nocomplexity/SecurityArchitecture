# Simple Checklists 

The landscape of cyber security solutions is filled with:
* Holy Grails and
* Failures

We are all humans. So for severe problems like mitigating cyber security risks we fall in love with so-called 'Holy Grail' products. The product capabilities of these products are outlined with vague and difficult marketing buzz. So perfect for managers who lack a solid technical background.  Of course you have to trust the vendor since these too-good-to-be-true products are never F/OSS products. This of course to hide the fact that magic solutions do not exist. And security by obscurity is a bad security principle.

Failed security products are doomed when deployed. These products are characterised by:
* a complex setup
* propriety solution and
* complex mandatory maintenance and update processes.  
Too often these products introduce extra risks instead of mitigating risks. Deploying these products can be compared with deliberately installing a large backdoor in your trusted environment.

Checklists help with improving all security management aspects like:

* Developing and improving security architectures and designs.
* Communication. E.g. after a security incident.
* Evaluating quality of solutions.
