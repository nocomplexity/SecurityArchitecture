## Dead simple security checklist 

Simple is hard. Especially to manage and mitigate cyber security risks. The context of cyber security problems consist of a mix of:
* People
* Complicated hardware and software
* Continues changes on all aspects involved
* Organizations 
* Internal and external threads
Putting a complex cyber security product in such a context is asking for failures. Stupid simple procedures and trainings for awareness are often as good or better than complex and expensive cyber security products to mitigate risks. 


A good cyber simple solution:
* does not reinvent the wheel.  
* is open source. 
* quality can be inspected
* follow the principles of reproducible build
* meets one or more open security standards that you can verify

A simple Cyber security product has:
1. Zero manual configuration challenges
2. Zero manual maintenance
3. Minimal dependencies and
4. Is created to do one thing, and only one thing, good!

A good simple cyber security products works without unnecessary additions and modifications in your perimeter. 

```{attention} 
**"The central enemy of reliability is complexity."**
```


Simplicity is the primary cyber security principle. All other principles must be sacrificed in favor of design simplicity. 


```{tip} Zero Complexity by design
