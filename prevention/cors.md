# CORS:Cross-origin resource sharing 

When dealing with internet and APIs you should familiar with Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). This is a mechanism to safely allow a web page or API to access restricted resources from a server on a domain different from the domain that served the web page. 

Solid information on working of CORS and help for implementation can be found on the Mozilla website.

The main issue when applying CORS is misconfiguration. This happens a lot, mainly caused by implementation without a proper design or implementations that do not follow the design completely. Continuous testing when having configurations with CORS enabled is a must.
