# Security Standards


## Applying  Standards and Best Practices

Using well-established security standards and best practices is one of the simplest ways to reduce security risks. However, challenges with security standards include:

- **Too Many and Inconsistent Standards**: With so many options, some standards may not be well-maintained or effective.  
- **Proprietary Standards**: Some require payment to access, making them harder to implement.  
- **Misleading Standards**: Not all published standards are helpfulâ€”some may even weaken security if applied incorrectly.  
- **Vague Standards**: High-level standards can be unclear, leading to misinterpretation and potential security gaps.

**The Importance of Open Standards and Clear Documentation**

Some government certifications require compliance with non-public security standards, which can be problematic. Ideally, security standards should be open and freely accessible (e.g., under a CC-BY license) and include clear examples for implementation.

While security professionals often use best practices, these can be subjective and vary by context. A more reliable approach is to avoid bad practices. The OWASP Top 10 list ([owasp.org](https://owasp.org)) is a helpful resource that identifies common security vulnerabilities to avoid.
