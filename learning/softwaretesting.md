# Security Testing Manuals


Creating software is hard. Testing security risks even harder. So make
use of good open testing guides.

## OWASP Application Security Verification Standard

The standard provides a basis for designing, building, and testing
technical application security controls, including architectural
concerns, secure development lifecycle, threat modelling, agile security
including continuous integration / deploynent, serverless, and
configuration concerns. See the latest version on the git repository:
<https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/v4.0.1> 

Or download the PDF from the project main page:

## OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for
mobile app security development, testing and reverse engineering. See:
<https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/overview/0x03-overview>


## OpenSSL: X.509 errors

A great guide to improve understanding of X.509 errors.

A must read and must known for everyone who claims to be capable of configuring and maintaining TLS. In reality: Almost no one knowns and understands all aspects of TLS in depth. 

Check the guides: [OpenSSL: X.509 errors](https://x509errors.org/).

```{admonition} Mission of this project
:class: note

Simplify the ecosystem by consolidating the errors and their documentation (similarly to web documentation) and better explaining what the validation errors mean.

Check also the [code repository and the readme](https://github.com/crocs-muni/usable-cert-validation).
