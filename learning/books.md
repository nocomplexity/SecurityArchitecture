# Open Access Books

Continuous learning is key for cyber security. 

Learning (new) Cyber security techniques, vulnerabilities or new protection measures does not have to be boring and expensive. 

The best security professionals share their knowledge under an open access license. So besides checking [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) use, reuse the quality open access cyber security as provided here.

## Cryptography

* A modern practical book about cryptography for developers with code examples. Practical Cryptography for Developers: <https://cryptobook.nakov.com/>

+++

* The Joy of Cryptography is a free undergraduate textbook that introduces students to the fundamentals of provable security. A lot of math. But this is crucial to really understand crypto. Created by Mike Rosulek. A cryptographer and associate professor in the School of EECS at Oregon State University. Check: https://joyofcryptography.com/

## IoT Security Reference Architecture for the Healthcare Industry

A growing number of health-related IoT devices are currently available in the marketplace, each incorporating different  aspects  of  the  reference  architectures  explored  in  this  document.  Before  standard  solutions  are available,  health  device  developers,  OEMs  and  IT  managers  should  be  able  to  identify  the  primary  IoT  and security management needs for their IoT for health solutions by using this reference architecture in conjunction with  suitable  risk  assessment.

## Low-Level Software Security for Compiler Developers 

With software security becoming even more important in recent years, it is no surprise to see an ever increasing variety of security hardening features and mitigations against vulnerabilities implemented in compilers. This book aims to help developers of code generation tools such as JITs, compilers, linkers and assemblers to overcome this.

## Malware Reverse Engineering Handbook

This handbook by CCDCOE Technology Branch researchers gives an overview of how to analyse malware executables that are targeting the Windows platform. The authors are presenting the most common techniques used in malware investigation including set up of LAB environment, network analysis, behavioural analysis, static and dynamic code analysis. The reader will become familiar with disassemblers, debuggers, sandboxes, system and network monitoring tools. Incident response and collaboration tools are also introduced.

## Programming Differential Privacy

Programming Differential Privacy, A book about differential privacy, for programmers
A great open book on this important security topic. Programming Differential Privacy uses examples and Python code to explain the ideas behind differential privacy! The book is suitable for undergraduate students in computer science, and no theory background is expected.

Programming Differential Privacy is executable. Using [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), so the same Sphinx based Jupyter tool chain  as this Security Architecture book. Each chapter is actually generated from Python code. 
Programming Differential Privacy is a living, open-source book. Link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uvm-plaid/programming-dp).
