# Security Courses

The best courses to learn how to simplify cyber security
are open. So open access. Open access (OA) refers to freely available, digital, online information.

We prefer open access security courses that use a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/).

Instead of creating yet another cyber security training or course, why not making an existing training resources better? 


## Basic course on security awareness

This is not a course like many others. This digital security course (or
"security awareness") will allow you to find out what are the correct
behaviors to keep to manage information securely.

ENISA works with these groups to develop advice and recommendations on good practice in information security. 

The ENISA CERT training material covers four main areas:
* Technical
* Operational
* Setting Up a CSIRT
* Legal and Cooperation

## Sha256 algorithm explained

Simple is often the best. This internet page is dedicated to learn you the SHA256 algorithm. 
The site [sha256algorithm.com](https://sha256algorithm.com/) will help you understand how a sha256 hash is calculated from start to finish. 
All is done online in your browser and step by step visually. 

The source code used for creating this site can be found on [https://github.com/dmarman/sha256algorithm](https://github.com/dmarman/sha256algorithm)

## Security awareness base course

Nice awareness training. Created by the an Italian Govermental
organisation. Note you need to install Hugo first in order to launch te
course.

## The Fuzzing Book

Software has bugs, and catching bugs can involve lots of effort. This
book addresses this problem by automating software testing, specifically
by generating tests automatically. You can interact with chapters as
Jupyter Notebooks. Great open book to spend some time on.
