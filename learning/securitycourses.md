# Security Courses

The best courses to learn how to simplify cyber security
are open. So open access. Open access (OA) refers to freely available, digital, online information.

We prefer open access security courses that use a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/).

Instead of creating yet another cyber security training or course, why not making an existing training resources better? 


## Basic course on security awareness

This is not a course like many others. This digital security course (or
"security awareness") will allow you to find out what are the correct
behaviors to keep to manage information securely.

## Capture The Flag 101 

Capture The Flags, or CTFs, are a kind of computer security competition. Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in a test of computer security skill.
In this guide/wiki/handbook you'll learn the techniques, thought processes, and methodologies you need to succeed in Capture the Flag competitions.

Check: https://ctf101.org/ 

## CTFtime

Great site with an archive of many Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. See the best teams, players and find  competitions. 
A real complete archive of past and future CTF events.

Check: https://ctftime.org/


## CTF Field Guide

 Learn to win at Capture The Flag (CTF). These competitions distill major disciplines of professional computer security work into short, objectively measurable exercises. The focus areas that CTF competitions tend to measure are vulnerability discovery, exploit creation, toolkit creation, and operational tradecraft.

##  Developing Secure Software

The “Developing Secure Software” (LFD121) course is available on the Linux Foundation Training & Certification platform. It focuses on the fundamentals of developing secure software. Both the course and certificate of completion are free. It is entirely online, takes about 14-18 hours to complete, and you can go at your own pace. 

Check this course (also available on EdX): [Free Course: Developing Secure Software (LFD121)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/developing-secure-software-lfd121/)

## Digitally Aware

Basic Security Awareness Training. Slides are available in Dutch and in
English on the github repository: https://github.com/radicallyopensecurity/Digitally-Aware


## Malware Analysis

Developed and used by RPISEC to teach Malware Analysis. Free to use and
to improve. See: https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware

## MITRE:Cyber Threat Intelligence Training

Great cyber threat intelligence (CTI) for everyone who is active in a
large (governmental)organisation.

The training contains five modules that consist of videos and exercises.
This training was designed to be completed in approximately 4 hours, and
may be completed solo or as a team. All training material can be found
at: https://attack.mitre.org/resources/training/cti/

## Open-Source Phishing Framework

Gophish is an open-source phishing toolkit designed for businesses and
penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily setup
and execute phishing engagements and security awareness training.
Download the toolkit from: https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/gophish

## OWASP Juice Shop

OWASP Juice Shop: Probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application. This application can be used in security trainings or
awareness trainings. The Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws as present in many
real world applications\... 

So hack the Shop on: http://owasp-juice.shop 

## Sha256 algorithm explained

Simple is often the best. This internet page is dedicated to learn you the SHA256 algorithm. 
The site [sha256algorithm.com](https://sha256algorithm.com/) will help you understand how a sha256 hash is calculated from start to finish. 
All is done online in your browser and step by step visually. 

The source code used for creating this site can be found on [https://github.com/dmarman/sha256algorithm](https://github.com/dmarman/sha256algorithm)

## Security awareness base course

Nice awareness training. Created by the an Italian Govermental
organisation. Note you need to install Hugo first in order to launch te
course. 

See: https://github.com/teamdigitale/security-awareness

## Security By Design

This Security by Design playbook outlines the core elements of the Security by Design methodology.
This playbook is initially created by the same team that started in 2015 with this open Security Reference Architecture.

## The Illustrated TLS 1.3 Connection

TLS can be black magic. So learning the details of the protocol helps. This great tutorial  guides you with great visuals through your TLS journey.
In this demonstration a client connects to a server, negotiates a TLS 1.3 session, sends "ping", receives "pong", and then terminates the session.

## The Fuzzing Book

Software has bugs, and catching bugs can involve lots of effort. This
book addresses this problem by automating software testing, specifically
by generating tests automatically. You can interact with chapters as
Jupyter Notebooks. Great open book to spend some time on. 

Git repository can be found on: https://github.com/uds-se/fuzzingbook/
