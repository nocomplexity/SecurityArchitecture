# Security References

Advantage in cybersecurity is gained by harnessing smart ideas. So we collect resources that work and are open to use. So open licensed cybersecurity references are preferred instead of resources that are a fad based on the latest technology buzz.

Creating a good solid cyber security solution is complicated. 
So the most valuable tip is:


```{admonition} Use and reuse good knowledge

Using and reusing **good** open cyber security references saves you time and improves the quality of your solution.

```


Good and excellent knowledge for building better security solutions is available under an open access licenses. This is why all references in this section are open access references or available for free under an open liberal license.

Too often information behind paywall turns out to be a fad or pure marketing information. So be warned!

## The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CC)

If you want to launch a product is many countries and want to make sure you follow all regulations per country: A smart thing is to make use of the common criteria checks.

The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CC), and the companion Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CEM) are the technical basis for an international agreement, the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA), which ensures that:

* Products can be evaluated by competent and independent licensed laboratories so as to determine the fulfilment of particular security properties, to a certain extent or assurance;

* Supporting documents, are used within the Common Criteria certification process to define how the criteria and evaluation methods are applied when certifying specific technologies;

* The certification of the security properties of an evaluated product can be issued by a number of Certificate Authorizing Schemes, with this certification being based on the result of their evaluation. These certificates are recognized by all the signatories of the CCRA.
