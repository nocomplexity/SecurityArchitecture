# Government security organizations 

Almost all goverments worldwide provide good advice for dealing with cyber risks. Some advice and tips for other goverments organisations but also for citizens and private companies.

Reinventing the wheel is a lost of energy and resources. Put effort on reuse already existing information. Below a collection of governments sites that provide good and open information on cyber security.



* [ Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI)](https://aucheck.com.au/). Core aim is to provide the Australian Government with fresh ideas on Australia's defence, security and strategic policy choices. .auCheck provides a series of tests that check whether your internet services follow standards advised by the Australian government and are up to date. .auCheck is a non-commercial, independent and free service.

* [Cybersecurity Library of US DoD](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Library/) Great collection of links to valuable security resources. Use it and improve it for your context! Also using these resources is good for inspiration when you need to create your own security architecture or how to perform a complex risks analyses in a large environment.
Zero Trust is everywhere, but I like the DoD created [Zero Trust reference architecture](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/(U)ZT_RA_v2.0(U)_Sep22.pdf)
