# Security Management

Security is just not an IT technology challenge. Security is in the end
a business issue that must be addressed, managed and controlled. So
people, processes, and technology(FOSS Tools).

Reuse of security control and management frameworks has a number of
advantages:

-   It saves time (and costs).
-   You can easily adjust and improve a good framework for your specific
    situation.
-   Special Security (FOSS)tools are available that are designed that
    make managing and controlling easier.

In order to control security and privacy risks, you should be able to
apply needed technical security and privacy policies for all your
systems, and monitor your systems to ensure they remain compliant with
the approved settings. The best way to manage this complex challenge is
to automate.

Using  automation is a necessary step for security and privacy. Good
automation tooling has the capability to apply security and privacy
settings for all your IT components in a simple, consistent, manner. And
you far better control in a large complex IT environment. This since
there is often a single point of truth where all settings are stored and
managed.

Good automation tooling has the capability to apply security and privacy
settings for IT components in a simple, consistent, manner. A single
point of truth where all settings are stored and managed offers
advantages for managing and reporting. But be mind: Not in call use case is using centralised tooling a good choice. The principle of separation
of concerns also applies for designing a security solution architecture.

A number of (FOSS) tools have proven to be usable for automating
security and privacy settings for all kinds of IT components:

-   Ansible: Ansible (<https://github.com/ansible/ansible>) allows you
    to simply define your systems settings for security. Ansible works
    with a Playbook syntax that allows you to define security settings
    for any component in a IT landscape. E.g. firewall rules, users and
    groups, or applying custom security policies for applications.
-   OpenSCAP (Open Source Security Compliance Solution). The SCAP
    (<https://www.open-scap.org/>) is a specification for expressing and
    manipulating data in standardised ways. SCAP uses several individual
    specifications in concert to automate continuous monitoring,
    vulnerability management, and security policy compliance evaluation
    reporting. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is U.S.
    standard maintained by National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST). The OpenSCAP project is a collection of open
    source tools for implementing and enforcing this standard.
-   Open Policy Agent (OPA). The Open Policy Agent (OPA -
    <https://www.openpolicyagent.org/> ) is an open source,
    general-purpose policy engine for Cloud environments that enables
    unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.
    OPA provides a high-level declarative language for authoring
    policies and simple APIs to answer policy queries. Using OPA, you
    can offload policy decisions from IT services.
-   InSpec. InSpec (<https://github.com/chef/inspec>) is a free and
    open-source framework for testing and auditing your applications and
    infrastructure. InSpec works of course nice together with
    Chef(<https://www.chef.io/>) . Chef is an automation language and
    tool for deployment to define your infrastructure as code.

Security and privacy is a complex field. So there is no silver bullet
solution for managing and controlling. There is also no single tool that
fits all use cases.
